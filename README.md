# Snake_Game
A modern take on the classic Snake game built using Python's turtle module. This interactive game challenges players to control a snake, collect food, and grow the snake while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own tail.

## Features
1. Dynamic Gameplay:
- Snake movement and collision detection with food, walls, and itself.
2. Food System:
- Randomly placed food for the snake to "eat" and grow.
-  Food repositions itself each time it's consumed by the snake.
3. Scoreboard with High Score Tracking:
- Keeps track of the player's current and all-time highest scores, saved persistently in a data.txt file.
4. Smooth Animations:
- The game uses Python's turtle module with optimized rendering for smooth gameplay.
5. Snake Growth:
- The snake dynamically grows longer with each piece of food consumed.
6. Customizable Controls:
- Arrow keys for navigation (Up, Down, Left, Right).

## Code Structure
- snake.py: Handles the snake's movement, growth, and collision logic.
- food.py: Manages food creation, positioning, and random placement on the screen.
- scoreboard.py: Updates and displays the score, high score, and game over message.
- main.py: Orchestrates the game logic and handles user inputs.
